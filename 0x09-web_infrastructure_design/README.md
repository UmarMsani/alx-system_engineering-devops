# Requirements
General
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
This project will be manually reviewed:
As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
Focus on what you are being asked:
Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
