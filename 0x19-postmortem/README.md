# 🚨🔥Application Outage Postmortem:🔥🚨

# Issue Summary:

# 🕒Duration of Outage:
Start Time: January 17, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End Time: January 17, 2024, 17:45 UTC

# 💥Impact:
The outage affected the core authentication service, resulting in a 30% degradation in user logins. Users experienced slow or failed login attempts during the incident.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as an unexpected surge in authentication requests due to a misconfiguration in the load balancing system.

# 🕒 Timeline:

* 👀 Detection Time:

  * January 17, 2024, 14:30 UTC
* 🕹️How Issue Was Detected:

  * Monitoring alerts triggered due to an unusual spike in failed authentication attempts.
* 🕵️‍♀️Actions Taken:

  * Investigated authentication service logs and identified the surge in traffic.
  * Initially assumed a potential DDoS attack and triggered DDoS mitigation measures.
  * Realized the misconfiguration in the load balancer was redirecting excessive traffic to a single authentication server.
* 🤦‍♂️Misleading Paths:

  * Explored the possibility of database issues leading to authentication failures, which was not the case.
  * Considered the involvement of a new software release causing instability but found no evidence supporting this hypothesis.
* 📣Escalation:

  * Incident was escalated to the DevOps and Network Engineering teams for a joint investigation.
* ✨Resolution:

  * Load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic among authentication servers.
  * Implemented rate limiting on authentication requests to prevent similar surges.
  * Normalized traffic patterns were observed, and monitoring confirmed the issue resolution.
# 🔍Root Cause and Resolution:

* 🕵️‍♂️Root Cause:
  
  * Misconfiguration in the load balancer led to uneven distribution of authentication requests, causing a bottleneck on one server.
* 🚀Resolution:

  * Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among available servers.
  * Rate limiting was implemented to prevent sudden surges in authentication requests.
  * System health checks were enhanced to detect and alert on misconfigurations in real-time.
# 🛠️Corrective and Preventative Measures:

* 🔍Improvements/Fixes:

  * Regular audits of load balancer configurations to catch potential misconfigurations.
  * Continuous monitoring enhancements to detect and alert on abnormal authentication patterns.
  * Documentation update for clear procedures on load balancer adjustments and incident response.
* 📝Tasks:

  * Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations bi-weekly.
  * Enhance monitoring thresholds and alerts for authentication service.
  * Develop and conduct a team-wide training session on recognizing and responding to misconfigurations promptly.
  * Schedule a post-incident review meeting to share lessons learned and discuss further improvements.
    
This incident highlighted the critical need for vigilance in monitoring and regular configuration audits. By addressing the root cause and implementing preventive measures, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future. The outlined corrective tasks will be diligently pursued to enhance the resilience and reliability of our authentication service.
